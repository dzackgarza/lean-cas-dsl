# Journal

Process narration lives here, not in chat: what was done, what was found, what is pending and on
whom. Chat carries only what needs the owner's action or decision. Newest entry first; one entry
per working session; terse. Not an authority: rules live in their owning documents (AGENTS.md).

## 2026-10-02 (orchestrator)

- Dispatches corrected against architecture.md "Authors" (a dispatch carries role, boundary and a
  pointer to or quotation of the owner's requirement; no content). Earlier briefs that carried
  assertions/expected values, kernel goal terms, row designs, or a kernel-repo read for the leaf
  author were stopped and replaced. Live: acceptance session_01Q9YWsNTV1zVddKmp7MRsbw,
  formalization session_01DPvLuRKBcdBVf1shacNovT, leaf session_014DrMxP5s6WX9xcYZRUrjyW.
  SendMessage cannot reach cloud sessions from this session; a brief is corrected by replacement.
- gov-meaning-permanence: `c5aa80e` on `b0/meaning-permanence` (claimQuestion fingerprint per
  statement in the report; check_question_permanence.py; gate wired). Pending: stability of the
  fingerprint across two runs; then the acceptance author records the initial questions.

## 2026-10-01, later (orchestrator, stage B: b0-typed-application)

Branch `b0/typed-application`, integrated into main. Delivered, each with a probe and a suite run
compared per assertion with main (no regression):
- `1ae53ea` b0-typed-application: applications admitted only at the declared signature
  (applyFamily, invariantOf); composed.charpoly/det/trace internal → invalid.
- `fa0a426` b0-selected-structure: recognition by declaration identity; (ℤ/n)^k and Vec(ℤ/n, k)
  distinct (registry audit: the only reducibly equal pair); SelectedStructureProbes.
- `ea432e4` b0-domain-preservation: ring-hom coercions kept, kernel homs only unfolded; the
  Poly∖0/Monic evidence goals no longer contain `RingHom.toFun`.
Dispatched formalization session session_01CRqVaA7aRUSwk1Q7LKgACe (lean-categories): numeral
coverage of the Poly∖0, Monicₙ, units evidence; a convergence domain for lim.
Remaining stage B: core-admission-realized holds by its existing probes; b0-binders waits on the
upstream assessment. The 6 Poly∖0/Monic failures and lim ×2 are upstream (below). Suite at main `3c8eaec`: 148 assertions; 52 hold, 85 gaps,
8 invalid, 3 internal. Classified:
- `composed.charpoly/det/trace` internal: `C.det()` applied `det` to the set `C` (continuous maps)
  where `n : ℕ` stands; `isDefEq` assigns without checking types, elaboration then crashes. Kernel
  (b0-typed-application). Repaired in `1ae53ea`: applyFamily and invariantOf admit an application
  only at its declared dependent signature; probe in RegistrationProbes. (These three still fail:
  `let C` is invalid, below.)
- 6 invalid "not an element of Poly∖0 / Monic": upstream. The kernel forms the numeral `k` of `R`
  by the numeral row as stated (`Int.castRingHom (asRing R) k`, NamedRings.lean:84); the evidence
  of `obj.sets.nonzero_polynomials` and of `Monicₙ` does not establish its property for polynomials
  with those coefficients (EvidenceTests.lean covers only literal coefficients). Same pattern as the
  recorded ℤ/5 `Units` evidence finding. Owner: lean-categories, independent assessment (Policy 2);
  the kernel does not reshape the numeral or write evidence.
- `calculus.limit_sinc`, `calculus.limit_infinity` invalid: no registered domain of maps convergent
  at a point. Upstream; b0-binders (independent assessment of the binder work).

## 2026-10-01 (orchestrator, session_01SKJ21csPEAnJmemqQztSVD)

State: integration branch `b0/construction` (head after this commit) carries #59 (stage A
kernel), #60 (B0 documents), the gate correction (`partial def` ratchet, kernel-totality gate
withdrawn) and the construction mandate. #59 and #60 are superseded vehicles; their branches are
kept.

Done:
- Stage A source: registry reader in the kernel; one outcome model; suite out of compilation;
  `scripts/check_acceptance_regression.py` (new failing assertion fails; missing report fails);
  export checked as a faithful projection of the registry state and against upstream's catalogue
  root (`LeanCategories.Catalogue`). No Lean change since `da209f5`; CI full build and
  acceptance-vs-base passed at `7dc2d7c`.
- Controller: construction-aware `prompt.md`; `review.py` phase from base `custodian/phase.json`,
  typed outcomes, outage ≠ rejection, mandate + context + explanation inputs, batches,
  reconsideration; `verify.py --construction`; workflows; authorship gate maps `custodian/` to the
  orchestrator in construction. `test_review.py`: 49/49 on a scratch copy.
- Documents: construction mandate (architecture.md), AGENTS.md "Current task: construct B0",
  CONTRIBUTING "Documentation and construction work", plan stage A. "You have no memory" deleted
  on a retracted instruction, then restored (`ce0ad81`).

Pending:
- Ruleset `ecustodian-main` (id 24252144): drop `pull_request`, `required_status_checks`; keep
  `deletion`, `non_fast_forward` (custodian/SETUP.md). Needs repository administration; refused to
  this session ("Write access to this GitHub API path is not permitted through this proxy").
  Then fast-forward `b0/construction` onto `main`.
- #59 "Build and audit": semgrep's exception lookup for the known `pull_request_target` finding hit
  GitHub's rate limit (403); one re-run queued (run 36893318437).
- Next construction work: stage B (`b0-typed-application`) once stage A is on `main`.
