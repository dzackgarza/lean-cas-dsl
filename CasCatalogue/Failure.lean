# Stratified failures (`specs/architecture.md`, "Failure is stratified")

A call can fail in kinds that are never collapsed:

* `invalid`: semantic. The expression names nothing registered, the operation does not apply
  (no structural route reaches its owner), or several semantic routes are not identified by a
  coherence.
* `noImplementation`: the operation applies, and no registered realization computes it on this
  presentation: no realizer, action, implementation, decider, equality or isomorphism.
* `ambiguousRealization`: several registered realizations apply, and choosing one is a
  realization choice that is not made here (CC-ROUTE).
* `unavailable`: a realization's backend cannot be started, or it failed while computing.
* `malformed`: a realization answered outside the protocol or outside the operation's result
  type.

A well-typed wrong answer is the fifth kind. The kernel cannot see it; permanent acceptance
detects it.

Each failure is thrown with its stratum as the tag of its message (`throwStratum`), and the
stratum is read back from the exception (`Exception.stratum?`). The rendering carries the
stratum's label, so a reader sees the kind of failure before its detail.
