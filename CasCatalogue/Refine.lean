# Same-object refinement (CC-PROP, CC-DECIDE)

A refinement of a category `C` by a property `P` is Mathlib's full subcategory `P.FullSubcategory`
with its inclusion `P.ι`. On a realization `d : R ⥤ C`, the handles proved to lie in it are the
full subcategory of handles on `P.inverseImage d`, denoting through `P.lift`. A proved decision
re-types a handle into it: the same handle, carrying the proof, whose image under the inclusion is
the handle itself and whose denotation's image under `P.ι` is its denotation, both
definitionally; a refuted or undecided decision leaves the handle where it was (`refine`).
Containment `P ≤ Q` is Mathlib's `ObjectProperty.ιOfLE`, and the refined handles follow it
(`refineLE`).
