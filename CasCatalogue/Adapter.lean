# The leaf contract (CC-ADAPTER, spec §5)

A backend leaf contributes through one Lean command, `register_leaf`, and only:

1. realizations of already-registered categories (`realizer`);
2. actions of already-registered functors on those realizations (`action`);
3. realizations of already-registered operations and decision procedures (`implementation`,
   `decider`), and registered isomorphisms between realized objects (`isomorphism`);
4. codecs — which live in the realizer's denotation and the decoders that produce its handles.

Each is checked by the registry's own validators, so it must typecheck against the semantic
universe. Everything else a backend might want to say is a *forbidden contribution*: it can be
written down (so that the attempt is visible) but `register_leaf` rejects it, naming the §5 rule,
and registers nothing from that leaf. New semantics come from `lean-categories` and the semantic
registry, never from a backend package (rule 5).
