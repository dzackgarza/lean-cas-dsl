# The leaf API

The one kernel module a backend leaf (`CasLeaves`) imports. Besides it, a leaf imports the
registered semantics it realizes (`CasCatalogue.Semantics.*`: category, functor, classifier and
operation identifiers and their Lean denotations). It exposes the types a leaf's contributions have: a realization is a
category of handles with a denotation functor (Mathlib; `InducedCategory`, `Discrete`, `Core` are the
usual handle categories), a `RealizedAction` is a handle functor with a `CatCommSq`, a `Decider`, an
isomorphism of handles, implementations; JSON for codecs; and `register_leaf`. A leaf module importing any other kernel module is rejected when it registers
(`addLeafRegistryEntryChecked`) and by the leaf-boundary acceptance probe.
