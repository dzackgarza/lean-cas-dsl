# Epistemic status and fused realizations (CC-TRUST, CC-ROUTE)

Every computed result records how much is known about it (FOUNDATIONS Remark 46.5):

* `kernelTheorem` — a Lean theorem about this very value;
* `leanChecked` — computed by actions proved to commute with denotation (`RealizedAction`);
* `certificateChecked` — a backend answer accepted because a Lean-proved checker accepted its
  certificate;
* `trustedAssertion` — a backend answer taken on trust.

A composite is only as trusted as its weakest step (`Trust.meet`).

A backend may realize a whole composite at once — "cardinality of a formed module" as one call —
as a *fused* realization of the semantic composite `M ∘ U` (#53 §10). It is registered against that
composite, never as a new method (CC-ROUTE). A `TrustedImplementation` is such a realization with
no proof: its type fixes what it claims to compute (the route functor `U`, the method functor `M`,
the denotations), and the registry records it as a trusted assertion.
