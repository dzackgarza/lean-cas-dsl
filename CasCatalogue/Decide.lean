# Property queries and three-valued decisions (CC-PROP, CC-DECIDE)

A property is a registered classifier `p : 𝒞.A → 𝒞`; nothing else owns property meaning. The
query "does `x` have `A`" asks whether the fibre of `p` over `x` is inhabited (FOUNDATIONS
Def. 46.4): `Classifier.Holds`.

A decision is `proved` with a proof, `refuted` with a proof of the negation, or `undecided`.
Undecided is the absence of a decision procedure, not a third truth value, so no combinator turns
it into a refutation: a conjunction is refuted only when a conjunct is.

A `Decider c d` decides `c.Holds` on the denotation of every handle of a realizer; it is
registered against the classifier `c`, never as a category or a runtime label.
